Returns the integer itself.

## Return value

`this`, unchanged. Provided so every numeric type answers the same
`tointeger`/`tofloat` pair without the caller checking which one it already
has.

## Notes

Takes no arguments, and that arity is fixed: unlike
[`types.String.tointeger`](sym:types.String.tointeger), which takes an
optional `base` for parsing digits out of text, the number-typed
`tointeger()` has nothing left to parse and was registered with no room for
an extra argument. `(5).tointeger(16)` throws a wrong-number-of-parameters
error rather than silently ignoring the base.

See [`types.Float.tointeger`](sym:types.Float.tointeger) for what happens
when the value being converted has a fractional part, or is too
large to fit in a 64-bit integer.
