Adds a member to the class, optionally as a static one.

## Parameters

- `key` - name of the new slot
- `value` - value stored in it

## Return value

The class, so calls can be chained.

## Errors

Throws `wrong number of parameters passed to native closure 'newmember' (N
passed, at least 3 required)` when `value` is missing; both `key` and `value`
are required.

On a class locked by [lock](sym:types.Class.lock), or one already instantiated
or inherited from, adding a non-static member throws `trying to modify a class
that has already been instantiated, inherited or is locked manually`. On a
frozen reference it throws `trying to modify immutable 'class'`.

## Notes

A third, boolean argument requests a static member: one value shared by every
instance rather than a per-instance default. The VM cannot report that
parameter, because this method is bound with a type mask, so it is absorbed
into the trailing `...` of the signature above.

A locked class still accepts a **static** member. Locking stops new per-instance
state, not new shared state, so `newmember(key, value, true)` succeeds where
`newmember(key, value)` throws.

Quirrel classes have no per-member attribute storage, so there is no
`attributes` argument, whatever older Squirrel-family references show.
