Creates a new instance of the class without running its constructor.

## Return value

A new instance whose fields hold the class's plain declared defaults - the same
values `ClassName()` would give them before the constructor runs, since
Quirrel never clones a field's default value per instance (see
`types.Class.newmember`'s Notes on default values, and the language reference
on class instances).

## Notes

Locks the class as a side effect, the same as calling `ClassName(...)` does: a
class permanently stops accepting new plain fields the first time any instance
of it exists, whichever way that instance was made.

Useful for a class whose constructor requires arguments a caller does not have
yet, or for tooling that wants a template instance to inspect without running
arbitrary constructor code.
