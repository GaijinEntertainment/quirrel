summary: Operator precedence, values that count as false, and the null-safe operators.
---

Most operators do what the same symbol does in C. The differences are which
values count as false, what `??` and `?.` check, and some precedence traps.

## All operators

Every operator the compiler accepts, with the metamethod that overloads it where
there is one. Each links to the section that explains it.

{{operators}}

There is no bitwise compound assignment: `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=` and `>>=` are all
compile errors. Write `flags = flags & mask` instead.

## Arithmetic

`+ - * /` and `%` work on `int` and `float`. Division of two `int` truncates
toward zero. An `int` mixed with a `float` gives a `float`. `%` keeps the
sign of the left operand, like C; it is not the mathematical modulo.

`+` also concatenates: if either side is a string, it converts the other side
to a string, so `1 + "2"` is `"12"` and not an error. Prefer `$"...{...}"`
interpolation to build strings.

## Comparison and three-way compare

`== != < <= > >=` compare two values and return a `bool`, not `0`/`1`.
`<=>` is the three-way compare. It returns an `int` that is negative, zero,
or positive when the left side is less than, equal to, or greater than the
right. This is the result [sort](sym:types.Array.sort) expects from a
comparator.

{{example:language/operators-compare}}

## Logical operators

`&&`, `||` and `!` treat `null`, `false`, the integer `0` and the float `0.0`
as false. Everything else is true, including `""`, `[]` and `{}`. Quirrel
does not treat an empty string, array or table as false.

`&&` and `||` short-circuit and evaluate to one of their operands, not
always a `bool`. `&&` evaluates its left side; if that is false, it stops
and yields it; otherwise it evaluates and yields the right side. `||` is the
mirror image. Only `!` always produces a `bool`.

{{example:language/operators-logical}}

## Null-coalescing and null-safe access

`??` looks like `||` but tests strictly for `null`. The false-but-valid
values above (`0`, `0.0`, `false`) pass through it. A plain `||` used as a
default replaces a real `0` or `false` with the fallback; `??` does not.

`?.` and `?[` are the null-safe forms of `.` and `[`. If the value on the
left is `null`, the whole expression is `null` and nothing throws. Once one
of them fires on a `null`, the compiler treats the rest of the chain (further
`.`, `[`, or a call) as null-safe too. `a?.b.c[0]()` needs only one `?.`, not
one at every step.

{{example:language/operators-nullsafe}}

## in, instanceof, typeof

`key in container` and `key not in container` test whether a slot exists.
On a table this means the key is present. On an array it means the key is a
valid index. This is a common trap: `20 in [10, 20, 30]` is `false` because
`20` is not a valid index, even though it is one of the values. Use
[contains](sym:types.Array.contains) to search by value.

`instanceof` tests whether an instance was made from a class or one of its
subclasses. `typeof` returns the type name as a string (`"table"`,
`"instance"`, `"array"`, ...), through the `_typeof`
[metamethod](page:language/metamethods#type-name-and-text) when the class defines
one. [type](sym:type) answers the same question as a function. It can be passed
as a callback, and it reports the plain type regardless of `_typeof`.

{{example:language/operators-membership}}

## The .$ type-method operator

A table's own slots and its built-in methods share one namespace, so a slot named
`len` or `rawdelete` hides the method of that name. `o.$name(...)` calls the
built-in type method directly and never sees the slot. The null-safe form,
`o?.$name(...)`, works the same way.

{{example:language/operators-typemethod}}

Plain `o.name(...)` is safe on data whose keys you control. On data parsed from
a file, received over a network, or passed in by a caller, use `.$`, because the
data cannot break it. The compiler's message for the forbidden `delete` operator
uses this form: `Use 'o.$rawdelete("key")' instead`. See
[types.Table.rawdelete](sym:types.Table.rawdelete).

## clone

`clone value` makes a shallow copy of a table, array, or instance: the
top-level slots are copied, but a container nested inside is shared with the
original.

`clone` is a keyword, not an identifier, so there is no `.clone()` method by
default:

```nut
let copy = original.clone()  // parse error: expected 'IDENTIFIER'
```

The `.$` form fails the same way, because the keyword is the problem, not the
slot lookup. Write `clone original` instead, or `original["clone"]()`.

With [`#forbid-clone-operator`](page:language/directives#delete-and-clone)
the operator is off and `clone` is an ordinary identifier, so
`original.clone()` and `original.$clone()` compile and call the
[clone](sym:types.Table.clone) type method.

{{example:language/operators-clone}}

## The newslot operator, <-

`<-` adds a new field to a table or instance. If the slot already exists,
`<-` behaves like `=`. The reverse is not true: plain `=` never creates a
slot. An assignment to a field that does not exist yet throws. `<-` is the
only way to add a slot.

`<-` needs a table or instance slot on its left, not a bare variable. `local
a; a <- 1` is a compile error ("can't 'create' a local slot"), because a
local binding is not a container that can hold new slots.

{{example:language/operators-newslot}}

## Compound assignment and increment/decrement

`+= -= *= /= %=` read the current value, combine it, and write it back, so
(like plain `=`) they need the slot to exist already. `++` and `--` work as
in C. As a statement the two forms do the same thing. As an expression the
prefix form yields the value after the step and the postfix form yields the
value before it.

{{example:language/operators-compound}}

## Overloading an operator

A class defines a metamethod to give its instances behaviour for an operator. The
name is the operator's metamethod from the table above, and it is an ordinary
method on the class.

{{example:language/operators-overloading}}

Three things to watch in that class:

- **A class cannot name itself inside its own body.** The binding does not exist
  until the declaration finishes, so `MyPoint2(...)` inside `_add` is
  `Unknown variable [MyPoint2]`. Use `this.getclass()`. It also works when a
  subclass inherits the metamethod. A
  [forward declaration](page:language/bindings) works too when the name is
  needed.
- **One `_cmp` drives the ordering comparisons.** `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` all go
  through it. Return a negative number, zero, or a positive one, as `<=>` does.
  `==` and `!=` are not among them. They compare raw identity, and no metamethod
  can change that.
- **`_typeof` changes `typeof`, not [type](sym:type).** `typeof muzzle` gives
  `MyPoint2` while `type(muzzle)` still gives `instance`, because `type` ignores
  metamethods by design.

An operator with no metamethod on the class throws; there is no default
fallback. An instance that defines `_add` but not `_sub` cannot be subtracted.

[Metamethods](page:language/metamethods) gives the contract of each one: what it
receives, which operand supplies it, and what the VM does with the returned
value.

## The static memoisation operator

`static` has two unrelated meanings. Inside a class body it declares a shared
member, described in
[Classes and instances](page:language/classes#static-members). In an expression it
is the memoisation operator described here.

`static expr` evaluates `expr` the first time control reaches it and caches the
result. Every later pass over the same place in the code reuses the cached value
and evaluates nothing. It binds like the other unary operators (`typeof`,
`clone`, unary `-`), so it takes the whole postfix expression after it.

Two consequences follow from "the same place in the code":

- **The cache belongs to the code location, not to the call.** A `static` inside a
  loop body evaluates on the first pass only, and every later iteration gets that
  first value. Two calls to the same function share one cache, because it is one
  location. Two identical `static` expressions written in two places have two
  separate caches.
- **A cached container is frozen.** An `array`, `table`, `instance`, `class` or
  `userdata` result is made immutable, as [freeze](sym:freeze) does, so a later
  write throws `trying to modify immutable 'table'`. This makes the shared value
  safe to hand out. A number, string or bool has nothing to freeze and is cached
  as is.

{{example:language/operators-static}}

Use it for work that is expensive and gives the same answer every time: a parsed
table, a lookup built from constants, a colour palette. Do not use it for
anything that depends on state the expression does not name, because nothing
re-runs it when that state changes.

[modules.reset_static_memos](sym:modules.reset_static_memos) empties every cache
in the VM. It is the only way to force re-evaluation. It exists for events like a
script reload or a resolution change, and it is too expensive to call often.

## Precedence traps

- `??` binds looser than the comparison operators, so `a ?? b > c`
  parses as `a ?? (b > c)`, not `(a ?? b) > c`.
- Shift operators (`<< >> >>>`) bind tighter than comparisons, so
  `1 << 2 == 4` parses as `(1 << 2) == 4`.
- `&&` binds tighter than `||`, as in most languages. Parenthesize a
  mixed chain when the reading is not obvious.
- Assignment is a statement, not a nestable expression: `p = q = 5` is a
  compile error ("'=' inside 'expression' is forbidden"). Write two
  statements instead.

{{example:language/operators-precedence}}

## delete

The `delete` operator is forbidden by default:

```nut
delete tbl.someKey
// Usage of 'delete' operator is forbidden. Use 'o.$rawdelete("key")' instead
```

Use `rawdelete`. It does the same removal as a regular method call and
returns the removed value.

{{example:language/operators-rawdelete}}

to the errors shown above.
