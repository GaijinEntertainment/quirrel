title: Compiler directives
group: Language
order: 88
summary: The `#` directives that turn a language feature on or off.
---

A line starting with `#` is a compiler directive. The directive is an
identifier-like word, with an optional `default:` prefix, that turns a
language feature on or off for the rest of the current unit. It is not a
comment (see [Lexical structure](page:language/lexical)). It is also not an
`#if`-style preprocessor: there is no expression, no macro and no condition.

- `#strict` / `#relaxed` - root-table access and `delete`, forbidden together.
- `#forbid-root-table` / `#allow-root-table` - whether `::name` may reach the root table.
- `#forbid-delete-operator` / `#allow-delete-operator` - whether the `delete` operator may be used.
- `#forbid-clone-operator` / `#allow-clone-operator` - whether the `clone` operator may be used.
- `#forbid-switch-statement` / `#allow-switch-statement` - whether `switch`/`case`/`default` parse as a statement.
- `#forbid-implicit-type-methods` / `#allow-implicit-type-methods` - whether a missing slot falls back to a type method.
- `#forbid-auto-freeze` / `#allow-auto-freeze` - whether array/table/class literals get frozen automatically.
- `#forbid-compiler-internals` / `#allow-compiler-internals` - whether a `$${ ... }` block may be used as an expression.
- `#disable-optimizer` / `#enable-optimizer` - whether the bytecode peephole optimizer runs.

Four features start off and need an explicit `allow` (or `enable`) to turn
on: the `delete` operator, the `switch` statement, `$${ ... }` blocks, and
auto-freezing literals. The other four start on and need an explicit
`forbid` (or `disable`) to turn off: root-table access, the `clone`
operator, implicit type methods, and the bytecode optimizer.

`#strict` and `#relaxed` change only root-table access and `delete`. They
do not change `switch`, auto-freeze, or any other feature.

## Scope

Without `default:`, a directive applies from the line where it is written to
the end of the block that contains it (a function body or a bare `{ }`). The
old value comes back when that block ends. At the top level, the block is
the rest of the file.

Three directive pairs do not follow that rule: `#disable-optimizer` /
`#enable-optimizer`, `#forbid-implicit-type-methods` /
`#allow-implicit-type-methods`, and `#forbid-auto-freeze` /
`#allow-auto-freeze`. The compiler resolves them while it generates code for
the enclosing function, not while it parses the block that declares them.
Their effect lasts until that function ends (or the file ends, at the top
level), even when the directive is inside a nested `{ }` that has already
closed.

## default:

A directive with the `default:` prefix also changes the VM's default for
every unit compiled later in the same process. This includes a module that
the current file `require`s later:

```nut
// main.nut
#default:forbid-root-table
let cfg = require("config.nut")   // config.nut inherits the ban, even
                                   // though it has no directive of its own
```

Without `default:`, a directive never applies to a separately compiled
file. Each file's parser starts from the VM's current default.

## Root table access

```nut
#forbid-root-table
::spawnPoint <- "hangar"
// Access to root table is forbidden
```

Everything placed in the root table through `::` is visible from every
other unit that shares the VM.

## delete and clone

`delete` is forbidden by default; `#allow-delete-operator` turns it on.
`clone` is allowed by default; `#forbid-clone-operator` turns it off. See
[Operators and expressions](page:language/operators) for what each
operator does and why `rawdelete` is the usual replacement for `delete`.

## switch

`switch` is off by default. Without
[`#allow-switch-statement`](page:language/control-flow), `switch`, `case`
and `default` parse as ordinary identifiers.

## Implicit type methods

By default, indexing a table or instance with a name it does not have falls
back to a type method of that name. `params.filter` is
[filter](sym:types.Table.filter) when `params` has no `filter` slot.
`#forbid-implicit-type-methods` turns that fallback off. A missing slot is
then always an "index does not exist" error, and never returns a function:

```nut
#forbid-implicit-type-methods
let params = { name = "alpha" }
println(params.len)
// the index 'len' (type='string') does not exist
```

## Auto-freezing literals

`#allow-auto-freeze` applies an implicit [freeze](sym:freeze) to every
array, table or class literal when it is built. `let squad = { hp = 100 }`
then creates an immutable table; [is_frozen](sym:types.Table.is_frozen)
reports it. The directive does not change the rules on
[Bindings and constants](page:language/bindings): the binding can still be
`let` or `local`, and only the value becomes read-only.

## Compiler internals

`$${ statements }` is a statement block used as an expression. Its value is
the value that a `return` inside it produces. It is for code that must run
more than one statement where only an expression is allowed. It is
forbidden unless `#allow-compiler-internals` is in effect.

{{example:language/directives-compiler-internals}}

## The optimizer

`#disable-optimizer` turns off the peephole passes that fold constant
arithmetic and collapse jump chains in the generated bytecode. It changes
the size and shape of the bytecode. It does not change what a script
computes or prints. Use it only to inspect a `-bytecode-dump` or to narrow
down a suspected optimizer bug.

## #pos

`#pos:<line>:<column>` is not in the list above. It does not accept
`default:` and it cannot be turned off. It sets the compiler's line and
column counters to the given position. Every error and every
[`__LINE__`](page:language/lexical) after it is reported against that
position, not against the line count of the real file. Tools that generate
Quirrel source use it so that error messages point at their own input, not
at the generated text.
