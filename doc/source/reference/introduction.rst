Quirrel is a high-level, imperative-OO programming language, designed to be a powerful
scripting tool that fits within the size, memory bandwidth, and real-time requirements of
applications like games.

It is based on Squirrel Script language (http://www.squirrel-lang.org/), but modified to be safer, stricter and faster.
Quirrel is not backward compatible with original Squirrel (see :ref:`Diff from original <diff_from_original>`)

Quirrel offers a wide range of features like dynamic typing, higher
order functions, generators, tail recursion, exception handling, automatic memory
management while fitting both compiler and virtual machine into about 6k lines of C++
code.

Repository is available on https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/quirrel and your PR's and feedback are welcome!
